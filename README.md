# Run

There are only a handful of controls for this game. \
To move the character left and right, use the left and right arrow keys. \
To make the character jump, press the space bar. \
To rotate the hall, press 'r' or 'w' to rotate clockwise and counter-clockwise respectively. \
We implemented physics-based motion with parabolic jumps and hall rotations, and collision detection with the interaction between the character and the hall.
